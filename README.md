# CS50 Bulbs Solution

This repository contains my solution to **Bulbs** from _Problem Set 2_ from the **CS50** course.  I've made slight modifications to ensure it works in the real _Visual Studio Code_ (VSCode) software, such as:

- Renaming `#include <cs50.h>` to `#include "cs50.h"`

However, it's important to note that the original code for the problem involving light bulbs (where they are either on or off) may not work as expected in the real Visual Studio Code (VSCode) environment.
Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
